6.1.2-SNAPSHOT (under development)
 - CORE: added `/ED:` command line option to exclude sub-folders from preprocessing (`excludedFolders` in Maven and ANT) with ANT pattern support.
 - CORE: added `/PI` command line flag (`preserveIndent` in Maven and ANT), turn on mode to preserve indent when removing `//$` and `//$$`, thanks to @jamuir
 - CORE: comma in split lines in BINFILE function moved from the start of line to the end of the previous line (to increase compatibility with Go)

6.1.1 (11 feb 2017)
 - MAVEN: information about imported maven properties will be shown only in either verbose mode or debug mode
 - MAVEN: added auxiliary goal `preprocessTests` which provides flag `useTestSources` as true and activated by default in GENERATE_TEST_SOURCES phase #14
 - MAVEN: added 'ignoreMissingSources' boolean parameter, allows to skip preprocessing if source folders not found or not provided #12
 - MAVEN: added 'skip'boolean parameter, it allows to skip execution, also it is possible to use `-Djcp.preprocess.skip=true` #13
 -  CORE: added function `BOOL is(STR,ANY)` to check existence of variable for its name and compare its value with etalon (through string conversion, it will ensure true for `true` and `"true"` case), #10
 -  CORE: added `STR str2go(STR)` function to escape strings to be represented in Golang sources
 -  CORE: improved the BINFILE function, it allows `base64|byte[]|uint8[]|int8` and modifiers `s|d|ds|sd` where s - means splitting to lines and d - means deflate compression

6.1.0 (03 jul 2016)
- implemented request #9, added support of whitespace between directive and comment, in command line it is `--es` option and in MAVEN and ANT it is boolean parameter `allowWhitespace`, by default it is turned off
- added function STR binfile(STR,STR) to load a bin file as encoded base64 or java byte array string
- changes in Preprocessor API, removed usage of null instead of PreprocessorContext or PreprocessingState as argument for many methods, improved tests
- fixed #8 issue, fixed work with absolute paths in //#include and evalfile(), added tests
- refactoring

6.0.1
- improved the MAVEN plugin to hide content of potentially sensitive properties from printing into Maven log (issue #2)
- added --z option ('compareDestination' in MAVEN and ANT) to check content of existing result file and to not replace it if content equals (issue #1), by default turned off because makes some overhead
- fixed --c argument usage in CLI, now by default the preprocessor started in CLI doesn't clear its output folder, use --c to turn it on
- improved tests
- minor bug-fixing

6.0.0
- bugfixing and log improvement
- RENAMED DIRECTIVE! //#assert renamed to appropriate name //#echo
- RENAMED FUNCTIONS! renamed XML functions to more appropriate and short names
- xml_getRoot to xml_root
- xml_elementAt to xml_get
- xml_elementsNumber to xml_size
- xml_getAttribute to xml_attr
- xml_getElementName to xml_name
- xml_getElementsForName to xml_list
- xml_getElementText to xml_text
- fixed //#exit and //#exitif behavior to prevent total exit and return level up in include stack
- added //#abort directive to provide possibility to stop preprocessing immediately without errors
- added function 'STR evalfile(STR)' for local preprocessing of a file body and return it as a string
- added predefined variables 'line','filename','filefolder' and 'file' which allow to get name and path parameters for the current preprocessing file path
- added predefined variables 'time','date' and 'timestamp' which work similar C++ predefined macroses
- added function 'STR str2java(STR,BOOL)' to escape and split string to be presented as java sources
- added functions 'STR str2js(STR)', 'STR str2json(STR)','STR str2xml(STR)' and 'STR str2csv(STR)'
- added functions 'STR xml_xlist(STR,STR)' and 'STR xml_xelement(STR,STR)' which allow to use xpath to get element lists an elements
- apache common-io and common-lang libraries have been packed into the jar and hidden
- added the short variant '//#ifdef BOOL' for '//#ifdefined BOOL'
- added '//#ifndef BOOL' to check that a variable is undefined
- added '//#definel NAME' and '//#define NAME' to define local and global variables, they can use not only the default TRUE value for defined variables, but also result of expression (example: //#define ten 2*5)
- added '//#undef NAME' to remove a variable definition from context
- added '//#error EXPR' and '//#warning EXPR' directives to throw exception and log warnings
- added support of custom line separator through the 'jcp.line.separator' system property
- added '//#noautoflush' to prevent auto saving text buffers after file preprocessing

5.3.4
- added support of test source folder preprocessing for maven projects
- added the "clear" maven goal to clear created preprocessing folders or any defined folders and files
- by default the maven plugin trying to keep numeration of lines in preprocessed files (the 'keepLines' is true by default)

5.3.3
- fixed the bug in the comment removing (multiple stars before closing slash)
- fixed the exception if there is not any organization tag in a project pom.xml
- added support for '-' and '--' prefixes in CLI arguments
- improved CLI argument error messaging
- the license has been changed to Apache 2.0

5.3.2
- very minor refactoring.
- fixed issue (ID 5) "Removing strings contain only spaces"
- the first version published in the maven central

5.3.1
- very minor bug-fixing, added the main-class attribute in the preprocessor JAR Manifest 

5.3
- Added feature to keep non-executing lines as commented ones (/k command line key), all non-executing lines will be saved in the output as commented ones

5.2
- Fixed issue (ID 3). The default charset was used to read text files.

5.1
- Fixed issue (ID 1). Inaccessible functionality both "load a file with global variables" and "define global variable" through a command line call. 

5.0 
- The initial published version of totally reworked preprocessor
